# A CHEF Repo to install Jenkins on a remote server  

This CHEF repo consist of a cookbook that installs Docker and runs a Jenkins Docker container on the remote server.  The Docker container runs and provides a basic install of the Jenkins on the server. Once the server is bootstrapped using the Role, the server endpoint can be accessed to finish the rest of the Jenkins installation and first admin user creation.
